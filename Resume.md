## Senior Engineering Manager, Comcast (VIPER - AltCon)
### January 2022 – Present

- Designed and implemented a new solution to replay production signaling into dev and integration lanes. This allowed for newer engineers to have hands-on learning while troubleshooting production incidents in a sandbox environment. It also enabled the nightly automated testing of our software to ensure stability was maintained from release to release at a near production scale.
- Wrote several tools to better assist the deployment team including a release notes delta tool. This ensured they could quickly see the large delta between older customer site deployments.
- Provided technical guidance as the subject matter expert on signal processing: ESAM, SCTE-35, SCTE-224.
- Managed a remote team of engineers, ranging from a co-op intern to principal engineers. Provided technical leadership, career mentorship, coaching, strategic planning, and hands on guidance as we navigated several highly impactful organizational transitions.
- Technologies used: Golang, Kubernetes, Helm, Terraform, Docker, Python
