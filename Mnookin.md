## Background & Story

I’m a technical software engineering manager with a strong background in software
development and system architecture. I started my career as a firmware engineer
working on the servo subsystems of hard drives. I then moved up the stack into
the cloud working on Cloud Foundry and it's open-source logging systems (loggregator).
For the last 7 years I have been in the video space working on alternate content
(blackouts and dynamic ad insertion). 
I transitioned from an IC to a manager in 2020 working as a player coach for much of that 
time.

I thrive in smaller, fast-moving companies where I can balance deep technical work,
leadership, and mentorship while avoiding unnecessary bureaucracy. I love helping
engineers grow, fostering a strong team culture, and working on software that has
a direct customer impact.

## What I Want Next
I’m looking for a remote-first role where I can:

- Work at a smaller company that values collaboration, trust, and impact over excessive process.
- Either lead a team or be a senior IC — I enjoy management but also love hands-on technical work.
- Mentor and support engineers, helping them grow in their careers and life.
- Build software that directly affects customers in a meaningful way.
- Avoid excessive process, constant on-call duties, and never ending context switching. 
  I am a strong advocate of time block planning and ensuring ICs don't get pulled into a "managers"
schedule.

I’m open to any industry and enjoy learning new domains. My focus is on working
with great teams, impactful software, and a culture of continuous improvement.

## How You Can Help
I’d love introductions to:

- Remote-friendly engineering leadership or senior IC roles in smaller, impact-driven companies.
- Companies that value strong engineering culture, mentorship, and technical excellence.
- People who have transitioned between management and IC roles successfully—I’d love to hear their insights.

If you know of companies or people who align with my interests, I’d greatly appreciate an introduction!
